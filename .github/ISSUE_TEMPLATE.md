This Issue is about (delete as applicable)

* A bug in the API (always say which version you're using!)
* A problem with my own code

API errors must include example code showing what happens, and why you don't believe this is the expected behavior. Issues posted without code take _far_ longer to get resolved, _if ever_. Feel free to use A [CodePen](https://codepen.io/Samid737/pen/pLVXag) template to demo the problem.

If your Issue contains _any_ form of hostility it will be instantly closed.
